# GUESS THE NUMBER AND PYTHON FUN

becoming fluent in a programming language is often a matter of practice and having fun while doing practice.
So, shall we try with a simple game in which are involved most of the programming features you'll need to use on daily basis.
The perfect candidate for this is a game called guess the number; if you don' t know what i'm speaking of, continue on reading.
The fact is that, even trying to do a simple thing like this, involves a certain number of topics. So, as we don' t have particular constraints for doing this, we can take this opportunity to make interesting digressions on important computer science topics.
To give only a brief example in this article we'll speak of recursion, binary search, time complexity, sorting algorithms and powerful, one-liners, pieces of code.
So, if this is in your taste, stay with us. To have your appetite even wetter, go seeing the list of [inspiring readings](#bib), at the bottom of this article.
